We also developed Business Intelligence tools to enable the heads of other departments to extract useful information from our Hadoop cluster.<br><br>Software development aside, I managed the company's relationship with various tech service providers, including contract negotiation and management of external teams.<br>During my time there, I spent a lot of time working on video streaming and encoding, both live and on-demand. I dealt with performance issues, ingest/processing workflows, encoding parameters optimization and the like."
